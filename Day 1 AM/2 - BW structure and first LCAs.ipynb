    "  - Learn about the general structure of Brightway and its most importand abstractions: projects, databases, activities and exchanges  \n",
    "  - Learn how to find objects (notably activities and exchanges), assign them to variables and work with them using their associated methods  \n",
    "  - Learn about how simple LCA calculations are done (one product, one impact category), and specifically how the different matrices are built and used  \n",
    "  - Learn how to extract information from the matrices (inputs or results) and translate them into nice, human-readable objects  \n",
    "  - Learn different ways to carry out comparative LCAs  \n",
    "  - Learn different ways to carry out LCAs with multiple impact categories"
